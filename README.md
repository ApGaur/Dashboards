# Coffee Sales Dashboard

## Problem Statement

The coffee shop industry is highly competitive, and our business is no exception. We've seen steady growth in recent years, but we need to better understand our sales data to identify opportunities for improvement and stay ahead of the competition. Our management team requires a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into our sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. With this information, we can make data-driven decisions to optimize our product offerings, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

## Key Metrics

- **Total Sales Amount**: $699K
- **Total Sales Quantity**: 214K
- **Monthly Average Sales**: $116K
- **Daily Average Sales**: $4K

## Sales by Store Location

The dashboard shows the sales amount by store location, with the top 3 locations being:

1. Hell's Kitchen: $237K
2. Astoria: $232K
3. Lower Manhattan: $230K

This data can help us identify which of our store locations are the most successful and guide our decisions on future expansion or resource allocation.

## Sales Amount and Margin by Month

The dashboard includes a line chart showing the sales amount and sales margin by month. This allows us to identify seasonal trends and patterns in our business, which can inform our inventory management, marketing campaigns, and staffing decisions.

## Sales Amount by Day of the Week

The dashboard includes a bar chart showing the sales amount by day of the week. This can help us optimize our staffing and inventory levels to ensure we're meeting customer demand during our busiest days.

## Sales Amount by Product Detail

The dashboard includes a bar chart showing the sales amount by product detail. This can help us identify our best-selling products and guide our product development and inventory management decisions.

## Sales Amount by Product Category

The dashboard includes a bar chart showing the sales amount by product category. This can help us understand which product categories are the most profitable and steer our business strategy accordingly.

## Sales Amount by Day Number

The dashboard includes a line chart showing the sales amount by day number. This can help us identify trends and patterns in our daily sales, which can inform our operational planning and resource allocation.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights provided by this dashboard, we recommend the following:

1. **Expand our presence in Astoria**: With the Astoria location showing strong sales performance, we should consider opening additional locations in this area to capitalize on the demand.

2. **Optimize product mix and inventory**: The sales data by product detail and category highlights our best-selling items. We should ensure we maintain adequate inventory of these popular products and explore opportunities to develop new complementary offerings.

3. **Adjust staffing and marketing for peak days**: The sales trends by day of the week indicate that Fridays and Saturdays are our busiest days. We should ensure we have sufficient staffing and marketing efforts focused on these peak periods to maximize revenue.

4. **Analyze seasonal patterns**: The monthly sales and margin data suggests there may be seasonal fluctuations in our business. We should further investigate these patterns and adjust our inventory, marketing, and operational plans accordingly.
